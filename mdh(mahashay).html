                    <h3><b>Bio-sketch of Mahashay Dharmpal Ji founder of M.D.H</b></h3>
                    <p class="para">Mahashay Dharampal is truly one of the most inspiring personalities of our times.  His immense modesty and down to earth charm deceptively hides the magnitudes of his persona and his inspiring accomplishments.  He is personality of many dimensions and achievements. He is a true Karamyogi whose contributions to the community, which need to be acknowledged and recognized, despite all his reluctance and refusals to come into the limelight.<br>

Mahashay Dharmpal was born on 27th March, 1923 in Sialkot (Pakistan).  His father Mahashay Chunnilal and mother Mata Chanan Devi were Philanthropic,  religious minded and followers of Arya Samaj.<br>

In the year 1933, he left school before he could have completed 5th class.  In 1937, he set up with the help of his father a small business of looking mirrors and thereafter soap business and carpentry job, cloth merchant, hardware business & rice trading.  Somehow these petty businesses could not hold him for long and he again joined hands with his father in his parental business i.e. Spices under the name of Mahashian Di Hatti popularly known as ‘Deggi Mirch Wale‘ people.<br>

After the partition of the country, he came to India and reached Delhi on<br>

27th September 1947.  At that time he was having only Rs.1500/- with him.<br>

Out of this amount he purchased a Tonga for Rs.650/- and drove it from New Delhi Railway Station to Qutab Road and Karol Bagh to Bara Hindu Rao at two Annas sawari for few days.<br>

Thereafter he bought small wooden khokha (Shop/ Hatti) measuring 14ft. x 9 ft. at Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi and started his family business of ground spices and again raised the banner of Mahashian Di Hatti of Sialkot “DEGGI MIRCH WALE“.<br>

With his vision, perseverance and a devoted honesty in business, Mahashayji led the venture to the heights, which have inspired others to follow.  Very few people know the success and the hard work of Mahashay ji behind the success of the super brand MDH.  Mahashay ji does’t have any secret formula behind his grand success. He just follows a traditionally established principle of honouring the commitments and serving his customers through pure and quality products.   His commitment to humanity and community and his relentless activities shine in many spheres of life.  Towards this he rises above the confines of religions and communities and never hesitates to serve the mankind, no matter what the cause.<br>

Started with a small 10 beds eye hospital at Arya  Samaj, Subhash Nagar, New Delhi during November 1975, thereafter in January 1984, a 20 beds hospital was established in JanakPuri, New Delhi to perpetuate the memory of his mother Mata Chanan Devi.  With 300 beds in about 5 acres land, this super specialty hospital with MRI, CT Scan, Heart Wing, Neuro Sciences, IVF etc. is the greatest gift for the people living in West Delhi as there is no other hospital of this standard in this area.  Mahashay ji himself visits the hospital regularly and actively participates in the management of the hospital despite all his hectic commitments in the ever-expanding business.  Like always, today also, poor people are treated free in the hospital and they gets free medical aid worth million of rupees annually.<br>

Mahashay Dharmpal has also extended his blessing to the children by developing a school to impart quality education to the new generations.  Today he is associated with innumerous educational institutions particularly MDH International School, Mahashay Chunnilal Saraswati Shishu Mandir, Mata Leela Wati Kanya Vidhayala, Mahashay Dharmpal Vidhya Mandir etc.  which hold a distinction that upholds the philosophy of harmonious co-existence.<br>

He alone has established more than 20 schools for the benefits of the society and the poor people at large.<br>

Spend a few hours with him and one would realize so many of his great deeds that will never be talked about.  For a man running a worth billion rupees business he has a surprisingly easy access to all.  One can never count how many girls from the poorer families are enjoying the happy married life, thanks to Mahashayji’s anonymous help.  Talk to the social organizations dedicated to the cause of helping such girls  and they will tell you he is one of their greatest benefactor.  And then there are so many children coming from the less privileged families.  Mahashay Dharmpal has taken on the responsibility of their education from their school fee to their books and other needs Mahashayji will never hesitate to come forward.<br>

Often seen as a religion person for his active and enthusiastic participation in community functions and festivals, Mahashayji is a personality above religions.  He is indeed a man of all communities.  Hindus, Muslim or Sikh he will be seen at all festivals or religious functions.  Anything that divides the community he wants no part of it.  May be that is the reason why he has stayed away from all controversies or allegiances of politics.<br>

The Philosophy of Mahashay Dharampal Ji is “Give to the world the best you can, and the best will come back to you automatically” has virtually been a proverbial come true by the fact that today, MDH is a name that stands synonymous not only for quality spices but also for its contributions towards the welfare of society and upliftment of the needy, by way of establishing Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Trust. MDH today stands as a name in every house hold, trusted & relished all over the world by millions.<br>

We believe that Mahashayji’s contributions need to be recognized as an appropriate acknowledgment of his services to the community.  Not just in recognition of Mahashayji’s contributions, but also to glorify his exemplary dedication so that it serves as an inspiration for others to follow.  More than that, a man like Mahashay Dharmpal deserves all the honour we can give.<br></p>
